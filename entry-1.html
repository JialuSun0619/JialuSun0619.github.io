        <h1><bold>Independent music</bold></h1>
        
            <body>Independent music (also commonly known as <bold>indie music</bold>, or simply <bold>indie</bold>) is a broad style of music characterized by creative freedoms, low-budgets, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">do-it-yourself</a> approach to music creation, which originated from the liberties afforded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_record_label">independent record labels</a>. Indie music describes a number of related styles, but generally describes guitar-oriented music straying away from mainstream conventions. There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre#Subgenre">subgenres</a> of independent music which combine its characteristics with other genres, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop">indie pop</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock">indie rock</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_folk">indie folk</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music#Indie_electronic">indie electronic</a>.
            <br></br>
            The origins of independent music lie in British independent record labels, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_Trade_Records">Rough Trade</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_Records">Mute</a>. In the 1970s, these labels contributed to the emergence of a distinct sound, influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk">post-punk</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music">new wave</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME">NME</a> released the influential compilation album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C86">C86</a> in 1986, and helped with indie's spread and development. American independent music first emerged in the 1980s, and was spread via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_radio">college radios</a>. Indie reached wide commercial success in the 1990s with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop">Britpop</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blur_(band)">Blur</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(band)">Pulp</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_(band)">Oasis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge">grunge</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)">Nirvana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam">Pearl Jam</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>). In the 21st century, indie inspired many distinct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre#Subgenre">subgenres</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_folk">indie folk</a>. Due to the internet, indie music saw a global spread in popularity, as music fans were no longer dependent on publications to find new music.
            <br></br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_record_label">Independent record labels</a>, important to the development of indie music, are characterized by their smaller operations, lower funding, and greater creative control as compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label">major labols</a>. Independent labels use a variety of methods of distribution, with the label generally owning the copyright for the sound recording. They generally give smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_against_royalties">advances</a>, or sometimes no advance, and some may offer higher royalty splits than major labels.

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <body>Although "Indie" was first used to described music released on independent record labels, the term grew to describe a specific sound.[1] A defining characteristic of indie music is that artists retain much more creative control over their music as compared to major labels.[1] Bands often have small budgets, and employ a do-it-yourself ethos which influences their sound.[2] Indie music generally represents guitar-oriented music which strays away from commercial conventions.[1] It often features lyrics that are earnest and emotive, with many cultural and sociopolitical references.[1] Many artists signed to major labels have retained creative control and are still considered indie artists.[2]</body>
