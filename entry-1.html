        <h1>Independent music</h1>
        <br><br/>
        <h3><b>Independent music</b> (also commonly known as <b>indie music</b>, or simply <b>indie</b>) is a broad style of music characterized by creative freedoms, low-budgets, and a do-it-yourself approach to music creation, which originated from the liberties afforded by independent record labels. Indie music describes a number of related styles, but generally describes guitar-oriented music straying away from mainstream conventions. There are a number of subgenres of independent music which combine its characteristics with other genres, such as indie pop, indie rock, indie folk, and indie electronic.</h3>
