        <h1>Independent music</h1>
        <br></br>
        <h3><b>Independent music</b> (also commonly known as <b>indie music</b>, or simply <b>indie</b>) is a broad style of music characterized by creative freedoms, low-budgets, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself"do-it-yourself</a></a> approach to music creation, which originated from the liberties afforded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_record_label"independent record labels</a></a>. Indie music describes a number of related styles, but generally describes guitar-oriented music straying away from mainstream conventions. There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre#Subgenre"subgenres</a></a> of independent music which combine its characteristics with other genres, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop"indie pop</a></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock"indie rock</a></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_folk"indie folk</a></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music#Indie_electronic"indie electronic</a></a>.</h3>
        <br></br>
        <h3>The origins of independent music lie in British independent record labels, such as Rough Trade and Mute. In the 1970s, these labels contributed to the emergence of a distinct sound, influenced by post-punk and new wave. NME released the influential compilation album C86 in 1986, and helped with indie's spread and development. American independent music first emerged in the 1980s, and was spread via college radios. Indie reached wide commercial success in the 1990s with Britpop (Blur, Pulp, and Oasis) and grunge (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and The Smashing Pumpkins). In the 21st century, indie inspired many distinct subgenres, such as indie folk. Due to the internet, indie music saw a global spread in popularity, as music fans were no longer dependent on publications to find new music.</h3>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Independent record labels, important to the development of indie music, are characterized by their smaller operations, lower funding, and greater creative control as compared to major labels. Independent labels use a variety of methods of distribution, with the label generally owning the copyright for the sound recording. They generally give smaller advances, or sometimes no advance, and some may offer higher royalty splits than major labels.</h3>
